## Design Guidelines

### When to Add Components Here

Add components to this folder when they:
- Are primarily UI/presentation focused
- Can be reused across multiple views
- Have minimal business logic
- Are self-contained and composable

### When NOT to Add Components Here

Keep components in the main `components/` folder if they:
- Are page/view components (Dashboard, ClientList, etc.)
- Have significant business logic
- Are tightly coupled to specific features
- Manage complex state or data fetching

## Import Pattern

Components in this folder should import from parent directories:
```tsx
// UI components
import { Button } from "../ui/button";
import { Dialog } from "../ui/dialog";

// Types
import { Client } from "../../types/client";

// Utils
import { formatDate } from "../../utils/formatters";
```

## Contributing

When adding new components:
1. Add clear JSDoc comments
2. Include usage examples in this README
3. Ensure responsive design
4. Follow existing naming conventions
5. Update imports in consuming components
