# PIT-37 Template Placeholder

## Note
The PDFFile folder does not contain PIT-37 forms. Available alternatives in PDFFile:

### PIT-R (Tax Return for Business Income)
- PIT-R_(21)02 2022.pdf
- PIT-R_(21)02 2023.pdf
- PIT-R_(22)13 2024.pdf

### PIT-2 (Annual Tax Statement)
- Multiple versions available

### PIT-OP (Tax Advance Payment)
- Multiple years available (2018-2024)

## Action Needed
To use PIT-37 functionality:
1. Obtain official PIT-37 form from the Polish Ministry of Finance
2. Place it in this directory as `PIT-37_2023.pdf`
3. Adjust the mapping.json coordinates if needed

## Temporary Solution
Consider using PIT-R forms which are available and similar in structure for testing the template system.
