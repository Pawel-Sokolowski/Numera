# Security Vulnerabilities Patched

## Overview

This document tracks security vulnerabilities found and patched in the Numera application.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. Validator Package Vulnerability (CVE-2024-XXXX)

**Severity**: Moderate  
**Package**: `validator@13.15.15` (via swagger-jsdoc dependency chain)  
**Issue**: URL validation bypass vulnerability in `isURL` function  
**Advisory**: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx

**Fix Applied**:

- Updated `swagger-jsdoc` from `6.2.8` to `7.0.0-rc.6` (latest stable release candidate)
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Created secure URL validation utility (`server/utils/urlValidator.js`)
- **User Input Protection**: All user-provided URLs validated using custom Zod validator with security checks
- **Scope**: The vulnerable `validator.isURL` is only used by Swagger for OpenAPI schema validation, NOT for user input
- Added `secureUrlValidation` function in `src/lib/validation.ts` for frontend validation
- All URL inputs in application use secure custom validator, bypassing the vulnerable function

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Before**: Low risk (validator only used in Swagger docs generation, not user input)
- **After**: Mitigated - Custom secure URL validation for all user inputs, updated Swagger to latest RC
- **Note**: The npm audit warning remains because it's a transitive dependency of Swagger. However, no user input flows through the vulnerable function.

### 2. XSS Prevention Enhancement

**Severity**: High (Preventative)  
**Issue**: Potential XSS attacks through user input

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Enhanced Input Sanitization** (`server/middleware/security.js`):
   - Removed `<script>` tags
   - Removed `<iframe>` tags
   - Stripped `javascript:` protocol
   - Removed inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, etc.)
   - HTML entity encoding for `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`

2. **Improved CSP Headers**:
   - Added `baseUri: ["'self'"]` to prevent base tag injection
   - Added `formAction: ["'self'"]` to prevent form hijacking
   - Added `frameAncestors: ["'none'"]` for clickjacking protection
   - Added `upgradeInsecureRequests` to force HTTPS
   - Enabled `noSniff` to prevent MIME type sniffing
   - Enabled `xssFilter` for additional XSS protection
   - Hidden `X-Powered-By` header

### 3. SQL Injection Prevention

**Status**: Already Implemented  
**Measures**:

- Parameterized queries in all database operations
- Validation utilities in `server/utils/validation.js`
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Input sanitization middleware

---

### 4. JWT Security Enhancement

**Status**: Implemented in Refactor  
**Measures**:

- Refresh token system with database persistence
- Token expiration and cleanup
- Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies recommended for production)
- Token revocation support

---

### 5. Rate Limiting

**Status**: Already Implemented  
**Configuration**:

- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests / 15 minutes
- General API: 100 requests / 15 minutes
- Strict endpoints: 10 requests / 15 minutes

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Validation

✅ Zod schemas for all user inputs  
✅ Server-side validation on all endpoints  
✅ Input sanitization middleware  
✅ Type checking with TypeScript strict mode

### Authentication & Authorization

✅ JWT with refresh tokens  
✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)  
✅ Token expiration and rotation  
✅ RBAC enforcement (infrastructure ready)

### Network Security

✅ Helmet.js security headers  
✅ CORS configuration  
✅ Rate limiting  
✅ HSTS headers  
✅ CSP headers

### Database Security

✅ Parameterized queries  
✅ Connection pooling  
✅ Prepared statements  
✅ No raw SQL string concatenation

### API Security

✅ Request validation  
✅ Response sanitization  
✅ Error handling without info leakage  
✅ API authentication

## Testing Security

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test XSS prevention
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>"}'

# Should return sanitized data
```

### Automated Security Scanning

```bash
# Run npm audit
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Security headers test
curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## Future Security Enhancements

### Recommended

- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy reporting endpoint
- [ ] Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN resources
- [ ] Implement API request signing
- [ ] Add honeypot fields for bot detection
- [ ] Implement CAPTCHA for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add security.txt file
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning
- [ ] Add Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Production Requirements

- [ ] Use httpOnly cookies for JWT storage (instead of localStorage)
- [ ] Implement secure session management
- [ ] Add intrusion detection system
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security audit schedule
- [ ] Penetration testing

Version: 1.0.1

## Summary

All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been addressed. The remaining npm audit warning for validator@13.15.15 is a low-risk transitive dependency used only in Swagger documentation generation. All user inputs are validated using custom secure validators that bypass the vulnerable function.
