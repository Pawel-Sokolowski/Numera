# Current Fix: MUI_HEADER_TEXT Not Found Error

## Problem
The NSIS installer build was failing with:
```
!insertmacro: macro named "MUI_HEADER_TEXT" not found!
!include: error in script: "D:\a\ManagmentApp\ManagmentApp\installer-resources\installer.nsh" on line 26
Error in script "<stdin>" on line 75 -- aborting creation process
```

## Root Cause
The custom NSIS script (`installer-resources/installer.nsh`) was using the `MUI_HEADER_TEXT` macro in custom functions (lines 26 and 106), but the MUI2.nsh header file was not included. 

A previous fix had removed `!include "MUI2.nsh"` to avoid "can't load same language file twice" errors, but this was incorrect - the MUI macros are still needed in custom functions.

## Solution
**Added `!include "MUI2.nsh"` back to the custom script.**

This is safe because:
- NSIS header files use include guards (similar to C/C++ `#pragma once`)
- Including MUI2.nsh multiple times doesn't cause duplicate definitions
- The include guards prevent conflicts with electron-builder's generated script
- MUI macros like `MUI_HEADER_TEXT` are now available in custom functions

## Changes Made

### 1. installer-resources/installer.nsh
```diff
  ; For details, see README.md in this directory.
  
+ !include "MUI2.nsh"
  !include "LogicLib.nsh"
```

**Result:** One line added at line 11, making MUI macros available in custom functions.

### 2. Documentation Updates
- **installer-resources/README.md**: Clarified that MUI2.nsh SHOULD be included, added troubleshooting section
- **FIX_EXPLANATION.md**: Rewritten to document complete fix history
- **NSIS_FIX_SUMMARY.md**: Updated with current and previous fixes
- **HOW_TO_TEST.md**: Updated with latest fix information

## What NOT to Include (Still Valid)
The following should still NOT be included in custom NSIS scripts:
- ❌ `Name`, `OutFile`, `InstallDir`, `RequestExecutionLevel` directives
- ❌ Standard MUI page macros (`MUI_PAGE_WELCOME`, `MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY`, etc.)
- ❌ Uninstaller page macros (`MUI_UNPAGE_CONFIRM`, `MUI_UNPAGE_INSTFILES`)
- ❌ Language definitions (`!insertmacro MUI_LANGUAGE "English"`)
- ❌ `Section "Install"` or `Section "Uninstall"` (use macros instead)

## Testing
The fix can be tested by running:
```bash
npm run dist-win
```

Or via GitHub Actions:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Build Windows Executable"
3. Click "Run workflow"

Expected result: Build completes successfully without NSIS errors.

## Summary
- ✅ Minimal change: Only 1 line added to installer.nsh
- ✅ Safe change: NSIS include guards prevent conflicts
- ✅ Preserves all custom functionality
- ✅ All previous fixes remain valid
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect correct approach
