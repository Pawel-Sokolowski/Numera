# Framework Upgrade - January 2025

## Overview
This document details the framework upgrades performed on January 2025, upgrading all dependencies to their latest **stable** versions while avoiding breaking changes.

## Upgrade Strategy

The upgrade followed a conservative approach:
- ✅ Apply all patch and minor version updates
- ✅ Upgrade to latest stable versions (not LTS, not beta)
- ❌ Avoid major version upgrades with breaking changes
- ❌ Avoid React 19 (not production-ready for this app)
- ❌ Avoid bleeding-edge versions (e.g., Vite 7)

| @types/node | 20.19.19 | 24.6.1 | Keep on Node 20 LTS types |

## Testing Performed

✅ **Build Test**
```bash
npm run build
```
- Result: Successful build with no errors
- Build time: ~8.3 seconds (consistent with before)
- Bundle sizes: Consistent with previous builds

✅ **Dependency Resolution**
```bash
npm install
```
- Result: All dependencies resolved successfully
- No peer dependency warnings
- No vulnerabilities introduced

✅ **Outdated Check**
```bash
npm outdated
```
- Result: Only major version updates remain (intentionally not upgraded)

## Benefits of This Upgrade

1. **Security**: Latest patch versions include security fixes
2. **Bug Fixes**: Minor versions include bug fixes and improvements
3. **Performance**: Optimizations in newer versions
4. **Stability**: All packages remain on stable major versions
5. **Compatibility**: No breaking changes introduced

## Future Upgrade Considerations

### Short Term (Next 3-6 months)
- Monitor React 19 adoption and stability
- Wait for community feedback on Vite 7
- Keep Radix UI components up to date with minor updates

### Long Term (6-12 months)
- Consider React 19 upgrade once ecosystem is stable
- Evaluate recharts v3 migration when documented upgrade path is clear
- Consider react-day-picker v9 when breaking changes are well documented

## How to Verify the Upgrade

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Run the application (if you have dev environment)
npm run dev
```

## Rollback Instructions

If issues are discovered after upgrade:

```bash
# Checkout the previous version
git checkout HEAD~1 package.json package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

## Conclusion

This upgrade successfully updated all frameworks to their latest stable versions while maintaining backward compatibility. The application builds successfully and no breaking changes were introduced.

**Upgrade completed:** January 2025
**Status:** ✅ Successful
