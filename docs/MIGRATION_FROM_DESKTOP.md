# Migration from Desktop to Web Version

## What Changed?

The Office Management System has transitioned from an Electron-based desktop application to a Progressive Web Application (PWA). This brings several advantages:

### Benefits of Web Version

✅ **No Installation Required** - Access from any browser  
✅ **Automatic Updates** - Always use the latest version  
✅ **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android  
✅ **Offline Support** - Service worker enables offline functionality  
✅ **Easier Deployment** - Single server for multiple users  
✅ **Lower Resource Usage** - No Electron overhead  

### What Stays the Same

✅ **All Features** - All functionality is preserved  
✅ **PDF Generation** - Still works (pdf-lib and jsPDF)  
✅ **Database** - Same PostgreSQL database  
✅ **User Interface** - Identical React-based UI  
✅ **API** - Same Express backend server

## Migration Steps

### For Single Users

If you were running the desktop application:

1. **Export Your Data** (if needed)
   - Your database is already in PostgreSQL
   - No data migration needed

2. **Deploy Web Version**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

3. **Access via Browser**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
   - Your data is still there (same database)

4. **Install as PWA** (optional)
   - Click the install icon in your browser
   - Works like the desktop app

### For Teams/Organizations

If you were planning desktop deployment for teams:

1. **Setup Server**
   - Deploy on a central server (see [PWA_DEPLOYMENT.md](deployment/PWA_DEPLOYMENT.md))
   - Configure with PostgreSQL

2. **Share URL**
   - Users access via `https://your-domain.com`
   - No installation needed on client machines

3. **Mobile Access**
   - Works on tablets and phones
   - Can be installed as PWA on mobile devices

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I still use it offline?

Yes! The service worker caches essential files, allowing basic functionality when offline.

### Do I need to reinstall?

No. If you have the database, just deploy the web version and access it via browser.

### What about the database?

Your PostgreSQL database remains unchanged. The web version connects to the same database.

### Can I install it like a desktop app?

Yes! Modern browsers allow you to install PWAs as if they were native applications.

### Is PDF generation still supported?

Yes! PDF generation works in the browser using pdf-lib and jsPDF libraries.

### What about my custom configurations?

All server-side configurations remain the same. Frontend preferences are stored in browser localStorage.
