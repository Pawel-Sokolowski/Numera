# ü§ñ Building Executables with GitHub Actions

**Don't have Windows? Don't want to install Node.js? No problem!**

GitHub Actions can build your Windows executable automatically in the cloud, even if you're on Mac or Linux!

---

## üåü What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a free CI/CD service that runs builds on GitHub's servers. You can use it to:
- Build Windows executables from Mac or Linux
- Automatically build on every commit or tag
- Build manually whenever you want

**Best part?** It's completely free for public repositories!

## üöÄ Quick Start - Build Your Executable Now!

### Method 1: Manual Build (Easiest)

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Visit: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ManagmentApp`

2. **Navigate to Actions:**
   - Click the **"Actions"** tab at the top

3. **Find the workflow:**
   - Look for **"Build Windows Executable"** in the left sidebar
   - Click on it

4. **Run the workflow:**
   - Click **"Run workflow"** button (blue button on the right)
   - Select branch: `main`
   - Click the green **"Run workflow"** button

5. **Wait for build to complete:**
   - The build takes about 5-10 minutes
   - You'll see a yellow dot (building) or green checkmark (done)
   - Refresh the page to see updates

6. **Download your executable:**
   - Click on the completed workflow run
   - Scroll down to **"Artifacts"** section
   - Click **"Office-Management-System-Installer"** to download

### Method 2: Create a Release (Automatic Build)

This method creates a release and builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

1. **Create a new tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Or use GitHub UI:**
   - Go to repository
   - Click **"Releases"** on right sidebar
   - Click **"Draft a new release"**
   - Click **"Choose a tag"**
   - Type `v1.0.0` and click **"Create new tag"**
   - Fill in release title: `Office Management System v1.0.0`
   - Click **"Publish release"**

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build Windows, Linux, and macOS executables
   - Upload them to the release
   - Create download links

4. **Download from release:**
   - Go to **"Releases"** section
   - Your executables will be attached to the release

## üîß Customizing the Build

### Edit Workflow File

The workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`. You can edit it to:

**Change Node.js version:**
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'  # Change this number
```

**Add more build steps:**
```yaml
- name: Custom step
  run: echo "Your custom command here"
```

**Change retention period:**
```yaml
- name: Upload Windows Installer
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    retention-days: 30  # Change to 1-90 days
```

### Build Configuration

The build configuration is in `package.json` under the `build` section:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "appId": "com.office.management.system",
    "productName": "Office Management System",
    "win": {
      "target": ["nsis", "portable"]
    }
  }
}
```

Edit this to customize:
- App ID
- Product name
- Build targets
- Icons and resources

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error: "npm ci failed"**
- **Solution:** Your `package-lock.json` might be out of date
- Run `npm install` locally and commit the updated file

**Error: "electron-builder failed"**
- **Solution:** Check the full error log
- Common issues:
  - Missing dependencies in package.json
  - Invalid build configuration
  - File path issues

**Error: "Artifact upload failed"**
- **Solution:** Check artifact size (max 2GB per artifact)
- Make sure files exist in `dist-electron/` folder

### Workflow Doesn't Appear

**If you don't see the workflow:**
1. Check file is in `.github/workflows/` folder
2. File must be valid YAML
3. Push to GitHub to activate
4. Go to Actions tab and refresh

### Can't Download Artifacts

**Artifacts not showing:**
- Wait for build to complete (green checkmark)
- You must be logged into GitHub
- Artifacts expire after retention period (default 30 days)

**Download is a ZIP file:**
- This is normal
- Extract the ZIP to get your `.exe` files
