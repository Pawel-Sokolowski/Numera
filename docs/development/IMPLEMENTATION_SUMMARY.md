# PostgreSQL Detection & Dual-Version Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to address PostgreSQL detection issues and add support for dual deployment modes (Desktop and Web).

---

## Issues Addressed

### 1. PostgreSQL Detection Problem ✅ FIXED

**Original Issue:** The installer only checked if `psql` was in PATH, which failed to detect PostgreSQL installations that weren't added to the system PATH.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Enhanced detection now checks **4 different methods**:
  1. PATH check (`where psql`)
  2. Windows Registry (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\PostgreSQL\Installations`)
  3. Common installation paths (`C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\`)
  4. Windows Services (`sc query postgresql-x64-*`)

**Impact:** PostgreSQL is now reliably detected even when not in PATH.

### 2. First-Run Database Configuration ✅ ADDED

**Original Issue:** Users had to manually configure database connection after installation.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created a **Database Setup Wizard** UI component
- Automatic detection on first application run
- Visual feedback with connection testing
- Step-by-step progress display during setup
- Works in both Electron (desktop) and web modes

**Impact:** Users can easily configure database connection through a guided wizard.

### 3. Web-Only Deployment Support ✅ ADDED

**Original Issue:** Documentation and configuration unclear for pure web deployment without Electron.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Comprehensive **Web Deployment Guide** (WEB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- New npm scripts: `web:build` and `web:start`
- Nginx and Apache configuration examples
- SSL/HTTPS setup instructions
- Production deployment best practices

**Impact:** Clear path for deploying as pure web application on servers.

## What Was Changed

### Code Changes

#### 1. Enhanced PostgreSQL Detection (installer-resources/installer.nsh)
```nsis
; Now checks multiple locations instead of just PATH:
- PATH (psql command)
- Windows Registry
- Program Files directories
- Windows Services
```

#### 2. Database Setup Wizard (src/components/DatabaseSetupWizard.tsx)
- New React component for database configuration
- Connection testing with visual feedback
- Step-by-step initialization process
- Error handling and user guidance

#### 3. Electron Integration (public/preload.js, public/electron.js)
- Added IPC handlers for database setup
- Exposed database methods to renderer process
- Automatic setup check on application start

#### 4. Application Startup Flow (src/App.tsx)
```typescript
// New startup flow:
1. Check if database is configured
2. If not configured, show Database Setup Wizard
3. After setup, show login screen
4. After login, show dashboard
```

#### 5. Web Application Support
- Already had dual-mode support (Electron vs Browser)
- Enhanced with better documentation
- Added dedicated build scripts

### Documentation Added

1. **WEB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide for web deployment
   - Installation on Linux/Windows servers
   - Nginx and Apache configuration
   - SSL setup with Let's Encrypt
   - Database setup and backups
   - Security best practices

2. **VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md** - Testing and troubleshooting
   - PostgreSQL detection verification
   - Desktop application testing
   - Web application testing
   - Database setup wizard verification
   - Common issues and solutions

3. **Updated README.md** - Clear explanation of deployment options
   - Desktop vs Web deployment comparison
   - Links to appropriate guides

4. **Updated DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md** - Easy navigation
   - All documentation in one index
   - Quick path recommendations

### Build Scripts Added

```json
"web:build": "npm run build:web && echo 'Web version built...'",
"web:start": "npm run build:web && npm run server:prod",
"server:prod": "NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js"
```

## How to Use

### For Desktop Application Users

1. **Install PostgreSQL** (if not already installed)
   - Download from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
   - Remember the password you set for the `postgres` user

2. **Build/Install the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dist-win  # Creates installer
   ```
   Or download pre-built installer from Releases

3. **Run the Installer**
   - Choose "Desktop Application" installation type
   - Installer will detect PostgreSQL automatically

4. **First Launch**
   - Application detects if database is configured
   - If not, shows Database Setup Wizard automatically
   - Enter PostgreSQL credentials
   - Test connection
   - Initialize database
   - Start using the application

### For Web Application Deployment

1. **Install on Server**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pawel-Sokolowski/ManagmentApp.git
   cd ManagmentApp
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure PostgreSQL**
   - Install PostgreSQL on server
   - Create database and user
   - Update `.env` file with credentials

3. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run web:build
   npm run server:prod
   ```

4. **Configure Web Server**
   - Set up Nginx or Apache
   - Configure SSL/HTTPS
   - Follow WEB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

5. **Access Application**
   - Navigate to your domain
   - Complete database setup if needed
   - Start using the application

## Verification Steps

### Test PostgreSQL Detection

```powershell
# On Windows, check if PostgreSQL is detected:
Get-Service postgresql*
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\PostgreSQL\Installations\*"
```

### Test Desktop Application

1. Build the application: `npm run dist-win`
2. Install on a test machine
3. Verify PostgreSQL detection in installer
4. Launch application
5. Verify Database Setup Wizard appears
6. Complete setup and verify login works

### Test Web Application

1. Build web version: `npm run web:build`
2. Start server: `npm run server:prod`
3. Access http://localhost:3001
4. Verify Database Setup Wizard appears (if fresh database)
5. Complete setup and verify login works

### Full Verification

See [VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive testing procedures.

## Architecture Overview

### Desktop Mode (Electron)
```
User → Electron Window → React App → IPC → Electron Main Process → Express Server → PostgreSQL
```

### Web Mode (Browser)
```
User → Browser → React App → HTTP API → Express Server → PostgreSQL
```

### Database Setup Flow
```
1. App Startup
   ↓
2. Check database configuration
   ↓
3. If not configured:
   → Show Database Setup Wizard
   → User enters credentials
   → Test connection
   → Initialize database
   → Save configuration
   ↓
4. Show login screen
   ↓
5. User logs in
   ↓
6. Show dashboard
```

---

## Configuration Files

### .env (Created by installer or manually)
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=office_management
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database Schema
- Located in: `src/database/complete_system_schema.sql`
- Automatically applied by Setup Wizard
- Creates all necessary tables and demo users

---

## Security Considerations

### Desktop Mode
- Database credentials stored in `.env` file
- File permissions should restrict access
- Consider encrypting sensitive data

### Web Mode
- **Always use HTTPS in production**
- Use strong database passwords
- Use random JWT secret
- Configure firewall to restrict database access
- Enable CORS appropriately
- Keep dependencies updated

---

## Troubleshooting

### PostgreSQL Not Detected

**Check 1:** Verify PostgreSQL is installed
```powershell
Get-Service postgresql*
```

**Check 2:** Verify it's in one of the checked locations
- PATH: `where psql`
- Registry: `Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\PostgreSQL\Installations\*"`
- File System: Check `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\`

**Solution:** If still not detected, you can skip detection and manually configure in the Database Setup Wizard.

### Database Setup Fails

**Check 1:** PostgreSQL is running
```powershell
Get-Service postgresql* | Start-Service
```

**Check 2:** Credentials are correct
```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -c "SELECT 1"
```

**Check 3:** PostgreSQL accepts local connections
- Edit `pg_hba.conf`
- Add line: `host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5`
- Restart PostgreSQL

### Application Won't Start

**Desktop Mode:**
- Check Electron console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
- Verify `.env` file exists and is correct
- Check if port 3001 is available

**Web Mode:**
- Check server logs
- Verify build files exist in `build/` directory
- Verify PostgreSQL is accessible
- Check web server configuration
