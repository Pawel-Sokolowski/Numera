## GitHub Pages Deployment

### Automatic Deployment Process

When this PR is merged to the `main` branch:

1. **GitHub Actions Triggers**
   - Workflow: `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`
   - Trigger: Push to `main` branch

2. **Build Process**
   - Runs: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Output: `build/` directory
   - Includes: All files from `public/` (including `pdf-templates/`)

3. **Deployment**
   - GitHub Pages uploads `build/` directory
   - All 39 PDFs become available at:
     ```
     https://pawel-sokolowski.github.io/ManagmentApp/pdf-templates/{FORM}/{YEAR}/{FORM}_{YEAR}.pdf
     ```

### How Files Are Accessed

The application uses TaxFormService to load PDFs:

```typescript
// Service loads from: /pdf-templates/{formType}/{year}/{formType}_{year}.pdf
// Which resolves to the GitHub Pages URL automatically

const service = new TaxFormService();
const pdfBytes = await service.fillForm('PIT-R', '2023', formData);
```

### Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.ts` is already configured:
```typescript
base: process.env.VITE_BASE_PATH || '/ManagmentApp/',
```

This ensures:
- Local dev: Uses `/`
- GitHub Pages: Uses `/ManagmentApp/`
- Files in `public/` are copied to `build/` automatically

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ All 39 PDFs included in build output
✅ Total size: ~5.6 MB
✅ Build time: ~8 seconds

### File Counts
- PDFFile folder: 40 files
- public/pdf-templates: 39 files (1 duplicate skipped)
- build/pdf-templates: 39 files

## Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, you can verify PDFs are accessible:

```bash
# Check if PDFs are available
curl -I https://pawel-sokolowski.github.io/ManagmentApp/pdf-templates/PIT-R/2023/PIT-R_2023.pdf

# Should return: HTTP 200 OK
```

Or open in browser:
- https://pawel-sokolowski.github.io/ManagmentApp/
- Navigate to forms section
- Select a form type and year
- PDF should load successfully

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ All files migrated
2. ✅ Build verified
3. ⏳ Merge PR to `main`
4. ⏳ GitHub Actions will deploy automatically
5. ⏳ Verify PDFs are accessible on GitHub Pages

### Future Improvements
- Add field coordinate mappings to mapping.json files
