./scripts/install-local.sh
```

The script will guide you through:

- ‚úÖ Dependency installation
- ‚úÖ Database setup
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration
- ‚úÖ PWA icon generation

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

git clone https://github.com/Pawel-Sokolowski/Numera.git
cd Numera

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate PWA icons
npm run generate-icons

# Setup database (PostgreSQL required)
npm run setup-db

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

#### Option 3: Server Installation (Docker or Native)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Pawel-Sokolowski/Numera.git
cd Numera

# Run server installation script
sudo ./scripts/install-server.sh
```

Choose between:

- **Docker** - Containerized deployment (recommended)
- **Native** - Direct installation with PM2

See [Server Installation Guide](docs/guides/SERVER_INSTALLATION.md) for details.

### Production Deployment

**Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)**

```bash
# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit configuration

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Option 2: Native Server Deployment**

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```

**Option 3: Static Deployment (GitHub Pages)**

npm run build

# Deploy via GitHub Actions (automatic)
# Or deploy the 'build' folder to any static hosting
```

The application works in two modes:

- **Full Mode**: With backend server - all features available
- **Static Mode**: GitHub Pages - documents stored in browser LocalStorage (limited to 5MB per file)

See deployment guides:

- **[Server Installation Guide](docs/guides/SERVER_INSTALLATION.md)** - Complete production setup
